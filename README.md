# mathcrowd-geometry-lib

This is a Typescript library for 2D geometry. It contains classes for elements like points,
lines, circles, and polygons, intersection detection. Shapes may be organized into Planar Set - searchable container which support spatial queries. It focuses on geometric operations and relations, not on rendering or styling. It can be used in both Node.js and browser environments.

It was developed for [omath.fun](https://omath.fun), an mathematics education
project. It was running by [mathedu4all.com](https://mathedu4all.com) an online community for math enthusiasts.

## Features

- Support finding the distance and segment between any shape.
- Support affine transform on any shape.
- Support finding all intersection between any shape.
